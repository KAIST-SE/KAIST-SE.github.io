Since the size and complexity of an SoS are significantly high, an SoS consists of multiple different levels and layers that should be differently engineered according to appropriate viewpoint-based methods.<\/p>\n<p>Our high-level architecture mainly defines 5 levels: Micro-level, Intermediate-level, Macro-level, Runtime-level, and Maintenance &amp; management-level. Based on the level definition, detailed layers could be internally designed according to a target SoS (and its type, goal, and constituents) to be developed. In addition, this architecture considers inherent uncertainties of an SoS. SoSs generally have both \u201copen-at-the-top\u201d and \u201copen-at-the-bottom\u201d characteristics, which indicate the uncertainty at higher levels and lower levels. Lastly, there are required interfaces between two different levels.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2.
