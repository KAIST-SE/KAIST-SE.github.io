To identify and define components comprising an SoS, we conducted an investigation of a real SoS case scenario, and identified objects were generalized into SoS-based terms and concepts. By using M2SoS, SoS engineers can be guided for their analysis and modeling activities, and they can also inspect completeness or correctness of their models considering SoS-specific characteristics. Also, another capability of M2SoS is to represent SoS ontologies for various SoS domains at the highest-level, and this enables SoS stakeholders (both SoS-level stakeholders and CS-level stakeholders) to establish a common knowledge base of their target SoS. If the ontology generated based on M2SoS is stored in a repository, vocabularies defined in M2SoS could be accessed and utilized for various purposes (for communications, maintenance, evolutionary development, etc.).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Overall Approach<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/se.kaist.ac.kr\/starlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/overall-approach_v2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-591 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/se.kaist.ac.kr\/starlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/overall-approach_v2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1332\" height=\"583\" srcset=\"https:\/\/se.kaist.ac.kr\/starlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/overall-approach_v2.png 1332w, https:\/\/se.kaist.ac.kr\/starlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/overall-approach_v2-300x131.png 300w, https:\/\/se.kaist.ac.kr\/starlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/overall-approach_v2-768x336.png 768w, https:\/\/se.kaist.ac.kr\/starlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/overall-approach_v2-1024x448.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1332px) 100vw, 1332px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In this study, we develop M2SoS in the following order. First, we selected a mass casualty incident (MCI) response system as a real SoS case system&#8212;we call this system MCIRSoS, and relevant documents and papers are collected for review. We analyzed the documents to identify objects comprising of MCIRSoSs and their operations, and parsed objects were generalized to represent SoS-oriented entities. At the same time, we defined several requirements for developing an SoS meta-model based on the investigation. Although we aim at developing a general meta-model for SoSs, there are too many SoSs for us to investigate. Our approach is first to focus on SoSs of a specific domain, and to propose a meta-model and then analyze it with general SoS characteristics.<\/p>\n<p>To develop M2SoS, we first take a look into some meta-model approaches for multi-agent systems (MAS). Since an MAS and SoS have a number of similarities, we reviewed meta-models for MAS to come up with basic ideas and concepts from them as follows.<\/p>\n<p><em>Table: Meta-modeling approaches of Multi-agent Systems (MAS)<\/em><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"142\">Meta-model<\/td>\n<td width=\"565\">Major component entities<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"142\">Gaia<\/td>\n<td width=\"565\">Organization, Organization Rule, Organizational Structure, Organizational Pattern, Role, Protocol, Activity, Responsibility, Permission, Safety\/Liveness Property<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"142\">O-MaSE<\/td>\n<td width=\"565\">Actor, Organization, Agent, Role, Goal, Capability, Policy, Environment Object Type, Environment Property, Domain Model, Protocol, Message, Plan, Action<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In order to develop a meta-model for SoS representation, we investigated several literatures related to Mass Casualty Incident (MCI) response systems which are real cases of SoSs. Through the investigation, we identify a number of objects comprising the response systems, and they are generalized into SoS-specific terms for developing a meta-model. Detailed scenario specification is uploaded on [Link].<\/p>\n<p>After investigating MCI response documents, we could determine some characteristics that should be considered to build a meta-model for SoS representations. To do that we specify four major requirements that M2SoS should consider and fulfill as follows.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Requirement 1: Distinguishing SoS-level entities and CS-level entities<\/li>\n<li>Requirement 2: Defining SoS-level goals, requirements, services, behaviors and relationships among these entities<\/li>\n<li>Requirement 3: Defining SoS-level environmental factors<\/li>\n<li>Requirement 4: Developing a meta-model for representing SoS ontologies<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Based on our investigation and requirements, we develop M2SoS by following several steps.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Step 1.
