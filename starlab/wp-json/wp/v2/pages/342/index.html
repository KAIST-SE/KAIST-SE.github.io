These actions need not be known at the SoS level, except the actions that are used to perform a role in SIMVA-SoS. For example, a FF could have range of actions including promoting fire safety via talks, advice and training sessions, using firefighting and rescue equipment, inspecting and enforcing safety standards, demonstrating the use of firefighting equipment, performing practice drills, working with police and ambulance service personnel, undertaking physical and academic training, and checking and maintaining vehicles, equipment, hydrants and water supplies.

In doing so, regardless of how they do it, the only requirement is communicating state of their action to related constituent systems. For example, how a FF perform the search or rescuing operation is encapsulated in its action. Independently they perform their action, and only communicate action status to the respective constituent systems.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"183\">Distribution<\/td>\n<td width=\"506\">Constituent systems in SIMVA-SoS exchange only information using the infrastructure provided by SIMVA-SoS. For example, in the MCI scenario under consideration, a FF communicate the status of its action to other constituent systems simply putting the information on the shared communication infrastructure. Thus, SIMVA-SoS provide <em>distribution <\/em>by enabling constituent systems communicate concurrently on logical time. Each constituent systems have a shared logical time tick to perform their atomic action at once.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"183\">Evolution<\/td>\n<td width=\"506\">The SIMVA-SoS simulation engine always keep track of constituent systems activity logs at each tick, and this enables to create consistent evolution steps and preservation of specified properties. In the MCI scenario under consideration, at each tick SoS state update, for example map update, is communicated to all constituent systems.

SIMVA-SoS provide a mechanism to manage the changes and direct them to the intended SoS level goal. In the MCI scenario under consideration, if a FF quiets its participation, the simulation engine can easily recognize it by counting missed self-status notification. The simulation engine, thus, free SoS level resources which were assigned to that specific constituent system (this can include restructuring and rescheduling the remaining constituent systems, or admitting if there are constituent systems that can play the role).<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"183\">Emergence of Behavior<\/td>\n<td width=\"506\">SIMVA-SoS identifies emergent behavior based on SoS level goal progresses.

New market requirements and emerging autonomously technologies such as IoT are shifting the manufacturing companies\u2019 environment toward smart factories. Thanks to IoT physical objects are seamlessly integrated into the information network where they can become active participants in business processes, communicate information about their status, surrounding environment, production processes, maintenance schedule and even more. In addition, rising energy prices, increasing ecological awareness, and changing consumer behaviors toward greener products are driving decision makers to put green manufacturing and energy efficient production processes at the top of their priorities. Furthermore, unlike the way in which existing factories provide products to customers, situations are changing in which factories produce and provide customized products to meet the needs of customers of late years. As a representative example, Jun Ji-hyun&#8217;s lipstick, which appeared in the drama &#8220;My Love from the Star,&#8221; has gained huge popularity in Korea, Japan and China. However, the company has never experienced inventory problems because the company analyzed customers&#8217; needs and increased production in advance by conducting a preliminary survey of SNS such as Instagram and Facebook. As such, Smart Factory should enable efficient production of products according to customer needs.<\/p>\n<p>There are four main components in this smart factory scenario. First is robots which are considered as autonomous constituent systems (CSs) of this scenario. In this scenario, there are two organizations, Manufacturing and Distribution. In manufacturing organization, we assume that there are three constituent systems, component management robots, process robots, packaging robots. In distribution organization, we assume that there are four CSs, stock management robots, cleaning robots, transferring robots (e.g., KIVA system), delivery robots (e.g., Amazon Prime Air). Second one is policies generated by analyzing customer behaviors. In this smart factory scenario, this smart factory can generate its policies by analyzing customers\u2019 behaviors in social networks. The third component is energy suppliers for robots. Each robot automatically charge itself before discharged. The last part is cloud computing platform that enables communication between robots.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(2) Real-world Example: SoS for Autonomous Collaborative Robots<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-665 alignnone\" src=\"http:\/\/se.kaist.ac.kr\/starlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/robot.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"770\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/se.kaist.ac.kr\/starlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/robot.jpg 770w, https:\/\/se.kaist.ac.kr\/starlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/robot-300x156.jpg 300w, https:\/\/se.kaist.ac.kr\/starlab\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/robot-768x399.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We consider a scenario that autonomous robots collect trash with cooperation. This robot scenario simplifies the main features of the smart factory SoS scenario. First, there are robots that collect trash at the sea as autonomous constituent systems (CSs). Each robots communicate to other robots for sharing the existence of trash and its positions. Second, the policies of the SoS affect the cooperative behavior of this robot system. In the smart factory scenario, the policies of SoS are automatically changed by the analysis of customer behaviors in SNS. However, in this robot scenario we assume that SoS managers set the policies of SoS. Third, this robot scenario also considers the energy issue same as smart factory. There are energy supplies that robots should revisit before they are discharged and SoS managers can set a policy of robot behaviors for minimizing the energy consumption. Lastly, we assume that each robot communicate by using internet connection at the cloud computing platform.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(3)Why is the autonomous collaborative robot scenario an SoS?<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"353\">Dimension<\/td>\n<td width=\"354\">Observations in the scenario<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"353\">Autonomy of constituents<\/td>\n<td width=\"354\">Constituent systems in SIMVA-SoS can have range of actions.
